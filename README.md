# MatchingGame-website
Hereby i am attaching the website link which i have created: https://elakkiya18.github.io/MatchingGame-website/
I have chosen the four different type of king and ace cards as images to be matched. It is 4*4 grid.
I have inserted my card images in HTML and created link for css and javascript in html.
In CSS i have styled my cards and background as i wish. I have used star background to enhance the website. 
I have used 3D transformation to flip cards.
If two cards that are flipped don't match with each other, it will shake the cards and then turn back to the original position. So here i have used shaking animation.
In javascript, i have set the timer limit for 60 seconds. after 60 sec the game will be ended and we need to restart it again by refreshing the page. 
It will popup one message after the time ends or if all the cards are matched within time limit saying that Game Over! refresh to restart
Shuffling the card.
If the cards that are flipped match with each other then 1 point will be added in the score.
